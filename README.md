# 15-251 Games!

This is a collection of simple, static web games I wrote for the class 15-251
Great Theoretical Ideas in CS, a discrete math course at CMU, in Spring 2014. I
found that being able to visualize certain board games made proving things about
them easier. You can play them live at <http://jez.io/15-251/>.

Try not to hate on these games too much! Most of them have all the HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript on the same page, none of the games have instructions, and there
are little to no comments. The objective was to prototype them as fast as
possible and get back to proof-writing.
